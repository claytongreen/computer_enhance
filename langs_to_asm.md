# How to view ASM output from your language

In Part 1 of the [Performance-Aware Programming course](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents), we learn to read assembly language through fun homework exercises where we simulate a few 8086 instructions. These assignments are designed to be completable in any programming language, so people can take the course in the language of their choice.

In Part 2, we learn to analyze compiler output and assess the performance of instruction sequences. This requires writing small snippets of code in a language that _can be compiled_. To allow people to take the course in as many programming languages as possible, I am collecting instructions on how to produce assembly-language listings in different languages.

Hopefully this will provide a growing quick-reference for people learning to read ASM to better understand the performance of their programs.

# Using Godbolt

If it supports machine code output for your language, Godbolt is often the simplest way to get a quick glance at the ASM for small programs. You cannot "step through" the ASM to see what it's doing like you can in a debugger, but it lets you see multiple compilations of the same program at once, which can be very useful.

* Go to [godbolt.org](godbolt.org).
* Select your language from the language drop-down.
* Select your compiler from the compiler drop-down. If you do not see a compiler drop-down (or if you'd like to add a second compiler), you can add a new compiler window by selecting `Add new... -> Compiler`
* If you are unsure what compiler options you should put in the `Compiler Options` box, consult the following table for recommendations:

| Language  | Compiler  | Typical Compiler Options |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| C / C++   | MSVC      | -O2 |
| C / C++   | GCC       | -O3 |
| C / C++   | CLANG     | -O3 |
| C#        | .NET      | |

Note that not all languages supported by Godbolt provide _actual_ ASM output. Some - like Python - only provide interpreter bytecode output, which is not particularly useful. The table above includes only those languages for which godbolt can produce real ASM.

# Using a debugger

To see source code along with reasonable ASM when using a debugger, you must ensure that your executable has been built with _both_ debug information _and_ optimizations. If you are unsure what switches are required for this, the following table can get you started:

| Language  | Compiler  | Typical Compiler Options |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| C / C++   | MSVC      | -Zi -O2 |
| C / C++   | GCC       | -g -O3 |
| C / C++   | CLANG     | -g -O3 |

Once you have an executable that has debug information _and_ optimizations enabled, you can load the executable into a debugger and step through the ASM using the instructions below:

### Visual Studio

* If you did not build the executable inside Visual Studio to begin with, you can open an executable directly by selecting `Open -> Project/Solution...` from the `File` menu, then picking `Exe Project Files (*.exe)` from the file type drop-down. This will allow you to open any executable for debugging.
* Press `F11` or select `Step Into` from the `Debug` menu to begin debugging the program.
* If you are viewing source code only, right-click in the source code window and select `Go To Disassembly` from the context menu.
* To step through system or library ASM without Visual Studio warning you, make sure `Enable address-level debugging` and `Show disassembly if source is not available` are both checked from the `Options` dialog under the `Debug` menu (`Debugging -> General`).

# Dumping an executable to ASM

Several command line utilities are available 

### Dumpbin

* Install Visual Studio if you do not already have it installed.
* Open the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" from the Start Menu.
* To disassemble an executable (in this case, "test.exe") to an ASM listing file, use:
```
dumpbin /disasm test.exe > test_disassembly.asm
```

... please submit a pull request! Note that in order to be included here, you must provide comprehensive instructions that allow someone to either step through or conveniently view the assembly language output of a program snippet.
